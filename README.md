# My Custom Templator Drupal 8 Module
   
  This module is designed to facilitate the creation of one or more page landing page, which has a distinctive layout from the site. This can be useful for the "About Us" pages, advertising pages and so on. It will also be useful when the pages have a limited lifetime or need to localize files in one place, so that it is easy to work with files and easy to delete.  
 
 You can add routes, templates and libraries or change the theme in the same file both in the plugin annotation and in the plugin methods. Plugin with resource folders are located along the path *modules/custom/sp_free_tpl/src/Plugin/TplPlugins*
